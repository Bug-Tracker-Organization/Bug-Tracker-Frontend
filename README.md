## Overview
### Description
Tracks bugs or issues that an organization has. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Project Management
- **Mobile:** This app would be developed for both desktop and mobile. The web application should be mobile responsive.
- **Story:** Creates tickets and assigns them to users within an organization. Users should be able to modify and comment on tickets.
- **Market:** Any organization that would need a bug or issue tracker to aid it in management.
- **Habit:** Users could use this SaaS 24/7.
- **Scope:** First I would create single organizations for users and all users could see all tickets for their respective organization. Later, I could add groups to an organization so users could only see tickets within their own group rather than all tickets of their organization.
